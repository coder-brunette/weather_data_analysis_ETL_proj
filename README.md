# ETL and ML Model for Weather Data Analysis
· Developed an end-to-end solution for weather data analysis using an ETL pipeline, machine learning, and REST API integration. Extracted weather data from an external API,
transformed and loaded it into a SQLite database. Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict temperature, fine-tuned the model, and deployed it via a Flask-based
REST API for real-time predictions.

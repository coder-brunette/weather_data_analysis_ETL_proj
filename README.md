# ETL and ML Model for Weather Data Analysis
路 Developed an end-to-end solution for weather data analysis using an ETL pipeline, machine learning, and REST API integration. 
路 Extracted weather data from an external API, transformed and loaded it into a SQLite database. 
路 Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict temperature, fine-tuned the model, and deployed it via a Flask-based REST API for real-time predictions.
路 Each functionality in the code is put in separate file named accordingly ;)
